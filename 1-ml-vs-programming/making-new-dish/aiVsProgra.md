# New Dish
Now, let's simulate making a new dish, where the program will "learn" from previous attempts to improve the dish based on feedback. We'll introduce a simple process where the program adjusts ingredients based on feedback (like a machine learning model adjusting based on data).


Explanation:
This program simulates the process of learning and experimenting, similar to AI/ML.

Initially, we have a list of ingredients for the dish, and the program "learns" from feedback (like a model would learn from data).

Each time the program runs, it adjusts the ingredients based on feedback, simulating how a machine learning model might adjust its parameters to improve.

The goal is to get "perfect" feedback, which would stop the loopâ€”just like an AI model finding the optimal solution after enough iterations.
