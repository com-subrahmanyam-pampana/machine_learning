# Making Tea as a Set of Instructions
def make_tea():
    print("Step 1: Boil water.")
    print("Step 2: Steep tea leaves.")
    print("Step 3: Add sugar or milk (optional).")
    print("Step 4: Pour into a cup.")
    print("Tea is ready!")

# Call the function to make tea
make_tea()



# Each step in the make_tea() function is an explicit instructionâ€”just like in programming, where each line of code has a specific purpose and must be followed in order.

# This is a simple, sequential process, and there's no variation unless we change the instructions (code).
