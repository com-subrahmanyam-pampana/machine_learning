# Explanation:
# This program simulates the process of learning and experimenting, similar to AI/ML.

# Initially, we have a list of ingredients for the dish, and the program "learns" from feedback (like a model would learn from data).

# Each time the program runs, it adjusts the ingredients based on feedback, simulating how a machine learning model might adjust its parameters to improve.

# The goal is to get "perfect" feedback, which would stop the loopâ€”just like an AI model finding the optimal solution after enough iterations.
